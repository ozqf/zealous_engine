### Zealous Engine

#### About

* Game engine using opengl.
* Inspired by old 90s FPS engines.
* Created for fun/learning and reference for other projects. I therefore doubt it will be of interest to anyone else!
* Written in C++ but in an older C style. I have deliberately avoided using most C++ features.
* I don't really know what I'm doing...

#### 3rd Party Libraries:

* GLFW for window
* GLAD for opengl
* stb_image.h for textures.
* OpenFBX for loading simple FBX model files.
